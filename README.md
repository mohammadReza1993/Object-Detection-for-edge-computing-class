# Object Detection for Edge Computing Class
In this assignment, we will explore the fundamentals of object detection and train a simple object detection model. After training, we will evaluate the model's performance and make it deployment-ready for NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

This project will provide hands-on experience in object detection and model deployment on embedded systems. ðŸš€
