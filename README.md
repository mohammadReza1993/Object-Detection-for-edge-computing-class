# Object Detection for Edge Computing Class
In this assignment, we will explore the fundamentals of object detection and train a simple object detection model. After training, we will evaluate the model's performance and make it deployment-ready for NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

This project will provide hands-on experience in object detection and model deployment on embedded systems. ðŸš€


# Object-Detection
Object detection is a computer vision task that identifies and localizes objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which only assigns a single label to an image, object detection predicts multiple objects, their locations, and their respective classes.
Object detection models typically perform three main tasks:
    1. Feature Extraction â€“ The model extracts important features from the input image.
    2. Object Localization â€“ The model determines the coordinates of objects in the image.
    3. Object Classification â€“ The model assigns a class label to each detected object.
