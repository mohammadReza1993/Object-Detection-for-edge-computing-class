# Object Detection for Edge Computing Class
In this assignment, we will explore the fundamentals of object detection and train a simple object detection model. After training, we will evaluate the model's performance and make it deployment-ready for NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

This project will provide hands-on experience in object detection and model deployment on embedded systems. ðŸš€


# Object-Detection
Object detection is a computer vision task that identifies and localizes objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which only assigns a single label to an image, object detection predicts multiple objects, their locations, and their respective classes.
Object detection models typically perform three main tasks:

  1. Feature Extraction â€“ The model extracts important features from the input image.
  2. Object Localization â€“ The model determines the coordinates of objects in the image.
  3. Object Classification â€“ The model assigns a class label to each detected object.
    
__Types of Object Detection Models__
Object detection models can be broadly categorized into:
A. Two-Stage Object Detection (Region-Based Methods)

  These models first generate object proposals and then classify them.
  They are generally more accurate but slower.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Faster R-CNN

  Uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to suggest object locations.
  The proposals are passed to a classification and bounding box regression network.

ðŸ”¹ Pros: High accuracy, good at detecting small objects.
ðŸ”¹ Cons: Computationally expensive, slower inference spe

B. One-Stage Object Detection (Single Shot Methods)

  These models directly predict objects and their locations without region proposals.
  They are faster but may be less accurate than two-stage methods.

ðŸ”¹ Examples:

  YOLO (You Only Look Once) â€“ Divides the image into grids and predicts objects in one pass.
  SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) â€“ Uses multiple feature maps to detect objects at different scales.
  RetinaNet â€“ Uses Focal Loss to address class imbalance.

ðŸ”¹ Pros: Real-time performance, efficient.
ðŸ”¹ Cons: May struggle with small objects or crowded scenes.


__Key Components in Object Detection Models__
A. Backbone (Feature Extractor)

  A convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts meaningful features from the image.
  Popular backbones: ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, EfficientNet.

B. Detection Head

  Two-Head Structure:
      Regression Head: Predicts bounding box coordinates.
      Classification Head: Assigns a class to each bounding box.

C. Anchor Boxes & Prior Boxes

  Predefined boxes of different sizes and aspect ratios are used in anchor-based models (e.g., SSD, Faster R-CNN).
  The model adjusts these predefined boxes to fit detected objects.

D. Loss Functions

  Classification Loss (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss for class labels).
  Regression Loss (e.g., Smooth L1 Loss or IoU-based loss for bounding box predictions).
  Focal Loss (used in RetinaNet to focus on hard-to-detect objects).

__Evaluation Metrics in Object Detection__

âœ… Intersection over Union (IoU) â€“ Measures overlap between predicted and ground-truth boxes.
âœ… Mean Average Precision (mAP) â€“ Evaluates overall detection performance across multiple IoU thresholds.
âœ… Frames Per Second (FPS) â€“ Measures inference speed for real-time applications.

__Applications of Object Detection__

ðŸ”¹ Autonomous Vehicles â€“ Detects pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs.
ðŸ”¹ Surveillance & Security â€“ Identifies threats in CCTV footage.
ðŸ”¹ Medical Imaging â€“ Detects tumors and abnormalities in scans.
ðŸ”¹ Retail & Inventory Management â€“ Tracks products in stores.
